## Description
This project aims to analyze the determinants for a woman being the primary source of revenue in a household using data from the "Conditions de Travail 2013" survey. The analysis will be focused on individuals living in couples in the same household.

### Objectives
The objective of the project is to analyze, based on the 2013 Working Conditions survey, the determinants for a woman being the primary source of revenue in the household.
1. Data Exploration & Management: Explore the dataset and the available data and handle missing data.
2. Feature Selection: The dataset presents 541 Columns/Features. A selection needs to be made to be able to conduct further analysis.
3. Build and evaluate a logistic regression model to identify significant predictors of a women being the primary source of revenue in the household.

### Dataset

- **Source**: Conditions de Travail 2013 (Volet "Actif")
- **Initial Dataset Size**: 33,673 individuals
- **Filtered Dataset**: Individuals living in couples at the same household
